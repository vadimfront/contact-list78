# Todo List Project

This is a small "Todo List" project created using Webpack. In this project, I learned how to work with local storage, which allows me to save data locally in the user's browser. By using local storage, I can store and retrieve task information even if the user closes or refreshes the page.

This project has been a valuable learning experience for me in developing web applications.
